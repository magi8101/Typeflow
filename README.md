<h1>current version:0.13.6</h1>

## Quick Start Guide

TypeFlow offers multiple ways to handle type conversions based on your needs:

```python
from typeflow import flow, TypeFlowContext, with_typeflow

# Method 1: Use flow() directly - the most explicit approach
result1 = flow(42) + " unicorns"
print(result1)  # "42 unicorns"

# Method 2: Use TypeFlowContext for a block of code
with TypeFlowContext():
    # Remember to wrap values with flow() inside the context
    num = flow(123)
    text = " in context"
    result2 = num + text
    print(result2)  # "123 in context"

# Method 3: Use decorator for functions
@with_typeflow
def make_sandwich(bread, fillings):
    # Arguments are auto-wrapped - no need for flow()
    return bread + fillings

print(make_sandwich("Wheat bread with ", 3))  # "Wheat bread with 3"
```

  42 unicorns
  123 in context
  Wheat bread with 3
  ```
</details>

## 🧰 API Reference

### Core Functions

#### `flow(value)`

Wraps any value in a TypeFlow type for seamless operations. This is the foundation of TypeFlow.

```python
num = flow(42)
text = flow("answer")
print(num + text)  # "42answer"

# Works with all major types
list_flow = flow([1, 2, 3])
print(list_flow + " items")  # "1, 2, 3 items"
```

<details id="run-output-3">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  
  ```
  42answer
  1, 2, 3 items
  ```
</details>

#### `enable()` and `disable()`

Controls TypeFlow globally - use with caution.

```python
from typeflow import enable, disable

# Enable TypeFlow globally (affects new objects created after enabling)
enable()

# Create new variables using built-in constructors
new_int = int(42)
text = " answers"
print(new_int + text)  # "42 answers"

# Disable when done to restore normal Python behavior
disable()
```

<details id="run-output-4">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  
  ```
  42 answers
  ```
</details>

Note: When using `enable()`, use the built-in constructors (`int()`, `str()`, etc.) to create values that can properly handle mixed operations.

### Context Managers

#### `TypeFlowContext(verbose=None, raise_errors=None)`

Creates a safe playground where TypeFlow is active.

```python
with TypeFlowContext(verbose=True):  # See what's happening under the hood
    # Use flow() to wrap existing values
    result = flow([1, 2, 3]) + " items in cart"
    print(result)

    # Or create new values with type constructors inside the context
    new_value = int(456)
    print(new_value + " is a new value")
```

<details id="run-output-5">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  
  ```
  typeflow - INFO - Converting list to string for concatenation with string: [1, 2, 3] -> '1, 2, 3'
  1, 2, 3 items in cart
  typeflow - INFO - Converting int to string for concatenation with string: 456 -> '456'
  456 is a new value
  ```
</details>

### Decorators

#### `@with_typeflow(verbose=None, raise_errors=None, auto_flow=True)`

Makes functions automatically handle mixed types.

```python
# Arguments are automatically wrapped with flow()
@with_typeflow
def calculate_total(quantity, price, coupon=0):
    # All arguments are pre-wrapped, so operations just work
    return "Total: $" + (quantity * price) - coupon

print(calculate_total(3, 9.99, 5))  # "Total: $24.97"

# For manual control, disable auto_flow
@with_typeflow(auto_flow=False)
def manual_calculate(a, b):
    # Here you need to use flow() manually
    return flow(a) * flow(b)

print(manual_calculate(5, "6"))  # Will convert "6" to a number and multiply
```

<details id="run-output-6">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  
  ```
  Total: $24.97
  30
  ```
</details>

### Configuration

#### `configure(verbose=None, raise_errors=None, log_level=None)`

Customize TypeFlow's behavior to your liking.

```python
from typeflow import configure, flow
import logging

# Set up verbose logging to see what TypeFlow is doing
configure(verbose=True, log_level=logging.INFO)

# Try a conversion that requires type handling
result = flow(42) + " magic beans"
print(result)

# Be strict and raise errors on conversion problems
configure(raise_errors=True)
```

<details id="run-output-7">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  
  ```
  typeflow - INFO - Converting int to string for concatenation with string: 42 -> '42'
  42 magic beans
  ```
</details>

### Custom Converters

#### `register_converter(target_type, source_type, converter_function)`

Teach TypeFlow how to handle your custom classes.

```python
from typeflow import register_converter, flow, TypeFlowContext

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Register how to convert Person to string
register_converter('str', Person, lambda p: f"{p.name} ({p.age})")
register_converter('int', Person, lambda p: p.age)

with TypeFlowContext():
    person = Person("Alice", 30)
    # Now you can do string concatenation with a Person
    greeting = flow("Hello, ") + person  # "Hello, Alice (30)"
    print(greeting)

    # And numeric operations using the age
    age_in_months = flow(person) * 12  # 360
    print(f"Age in months: {age_in_months}")
```

<details id="run-output-8">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  
  ```
  Hello, Alice (30)
  Age in months: 360
  ```
</details>

## Real-World Examples

### Data Processing

```python
from typeflow import flow

# Mixed data from a CSV file or API
user_data = [
    {"id": "1001", "visits": 5, "active": "true"},
    {"id": 1002, "visits": "12", "active": 1},
    {"id": 1003, "visits": None, "active": "false"}
]

# Process without worrying about types
def process_user(user):
    activity_score = flow(user["visits"]) * (1 if flow(user["active"]) else 0.5)
    return f"User {user['id']} has a score of {activity_score}"

for user in user_data:
    print(process_user(user))
```

<details id="run-output-9">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  
  ```
  User 1001 has a score of 5.0
  User 1002 has a score of 12.0
  User 1003 has a score of 0.0
  ```
</details>

### Form Input Processing

```python
from typeflow import with_typeflow

# Input values from a web form
form_data = {
    "quantity": "3",
    "price": 24.99,
    "discount": "5",
    "is_member": "true"
}

@with_typeflow
def calculate_order(quantity, price, discount=0, is_member=False):
    subtotal = quantity * price
    member_discount = subtotal * 0.1 if is_member else 0
    return subtotal - discount - member_discount

total = calculate_order(
    form_data["quantity"],
    form_data["price"],
    form_data["discount"],
    form_data["is_member"]
)
print(f"Order total: ${total:.2f}")
```

<details id="run-output-10">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  
  ```
  Order total: $62.47
  ```
</details>

## Command-Line Interface

TypeFlow comes with a simple command-line interface:

```bash
# Show version information
typeflow --version

# Enable TypeFlow globally
typeflow --enable

# Enable with verbose mode
typeflow --enable --verbose

# Disable TypeFlow
typeflow --disable
```

<details id="run-output-11">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  
  ```
  TypeFlow version 0.13.6
  
  # When enabling:
  TypeFlow has been enabled globally
  
  # When disabling:
  TypeFlow has been disabled globally
  ```
</details>

## Limitations

- Currently, TypeFlow works best when explicitly wrapping values with `flow()`. Global `enable()` works but requires creating new values using type constructors.
- Due to Python's immutable built-in types, patching existing values directly isn't possible in all cases.
- Performance impact is minimal for most operations, but may be noticeable in tight loops with many conversions.

## Uploading to PyPI

If you've made improvements to TypeFlow and want to share them with the world, here's how to upload your package to PyPI:

### 1. Prepare your package

Make sure your package structure is correct:

```
TypeFlow/
├── typeflow/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── core.py
│   └── ...
├── setup.py
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

### 2. Install build tools

```bash
pip install build twine
```

### 3. Build distribution packages

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
python -m build
```

This creates distribution packages in the `dist/` directory.

### 4. Upload to PyPI

#### Test PyPI first (recommended)

```bash
python -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```

#### Upload to production PyPI

```bash
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

You'll need to provide your PyPI username and password or API token.

### 5. Verify installation

```bash
# From test PyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ typeflow

# From production PyPI
pip install typeflow
```

## Publishing with GitHub Actions

TypeFlow uses GitHub Actions for automated publishing to PyPI. To set up your own fork for publishing:

1. **Create a PyPI API token**:

   - Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/
   - Create an API token with the scope limited to your project

2. **Set up GitHub repository**:

   - In your repository, go to Settings > Environments
   - Create a new environment named `pypi`
   - Add a secret called `PYPI_API_TOKEN` with your PyPI token value

3. **Set up PyPI Trusted Publisher**:

   - In PyPI project settings, add a new "Trusted Publisher"
   - Configure with these values:
     - **PyPI Project Name**: typeflow
     - **Owner**: your GitHub username or organization name
     - **Repository name**: typeflow
     - **Workflow name**: publish.yml
     - **Environment name**: pypi

4. **Publish a new version**:
   - Update version in `setup.py`
   - Create a new GitHub Release
   - The workflow will automatically publish to PyPI

This implements modern OIDC authentication between GitHub and PyPI, eliminating the need for long-lived API tokens.

## Philosophy

TypeFlow follows the "batteries included" and "it should just work" philosophy of Python, tackling one of the few remaining pain points in Python's smooth developer experience.
